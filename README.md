#Description
This show simple example of how works Asp.Net MVC with the Bind Attribute for controller's actions.

#How to use it
1. Start the application, you should be redirected to /MyModel/Create. This web page has 5 textboxes. You can enter data and submit. You should see the result into the View Bag section.
2. Go to /MyModel/CreateWithBindingExclude. Do the same thing and you will see that the view bag does not have all properties information.
3. Go to /MyModel/CreateWithBindingInclude. Do the same thing and you will see not all the properties. This time, it is white listed instead of black listed.
